# What is Ducky Script converter?

This script converts your Ducky Script to Arduino sketch. Also you can edit regular Arduino code to improve it for your ATmega32u4 board.

No third-party libraries are required to work. **You can use pure Python.**

This app supports all Ducky Script commands. Thats why you can use your ATmega32u4 board as Rubber Ducky to the full.
